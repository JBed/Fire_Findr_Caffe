**fine details are improtance**

In the case of just visable smoke the model needs to understand how the details of the smoke distinguish it from just a cloud

this is known to be diff...

**the big picture is important***

for distingusing fire damage from damage caused by earthquacks or tornados the model need to not focus on the specifiys of how things are lay (as this random)

insead needs to look at the big picture such as black-ness that is uniquly caused

In the above I addresed how each of the specific issues could be addresed
the real chalange for our model is to excell at each of these tasks simultaniously.

what we can learn from this case is that sometimes it is difficult even for humans to really know what is going on.

This finding is consistant with current literature (for example [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/09/02/what-i-learned-from-competing-against-a-convnet-on-imagenet/)). 


### conclusions

-> As mentioned the conclusiton of the building the training set... training is a process....

-> Even with mroe time to iterativly improve our training set (and therefor classifyer) there are still fundametal issure that remin. 

-> overall fire is multi facited in nature this muti-fasitiness make it;s detection difficult.
or soemthing like this...


**Loss fucntion and solver**

A loss function specifies the goal of learning by mapping parameter settings (i.e., the current network weights) to a scalar value specifying the “badness” of these parameter settings. Hence, the goal of learning is to find a setting of the weights that minimizes the loss function.

To opt the loss fucntion I used SGD.
